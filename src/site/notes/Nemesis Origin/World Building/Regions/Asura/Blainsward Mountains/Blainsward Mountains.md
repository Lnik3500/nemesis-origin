The northern Blainsward Mountains are a formidable range, home to the proud and industrious [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Races/Dwarves\|dwarves]]. These mountains are rich in minerals and precious stones, mined by the [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Races/Dwarves\|dwarves]] who live in [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Settlements/Kurbadur/Kurbadur\|Kurbadur]]. The Blainsward Mountains are fiercely protected by a gigantic [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Races/Dwarves\|dwarven]] wall, built to shield the inhabitants from the dangerous lava ash that periodically erupts from the range's volcanic activity. The wall, an architectural marvel, also serves as a symbol of [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Races/Dwarves\|dwarven]] resilience and craftsmanship.
