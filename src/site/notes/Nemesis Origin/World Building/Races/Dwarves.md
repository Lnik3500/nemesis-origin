Native to [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Regions/Asura/Blainsward Mountains/Blainsward Mountains\|Blainsward Mountains]], these dwarves are not to be triffled with. They have setup multiple mines across and export those materials to [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Settlements/Kurbadur/Kurbadur\|Kurbadur]] or to [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Settlements/Everstead/Everstead\|Everstead]] for trading precious wood, which doesn't grow in their habitat. Their borders are somewhat strict, only letting certain individuals with letter of approval through or if they're native.
