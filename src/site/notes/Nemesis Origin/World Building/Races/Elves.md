Elves used to mostly predominant in [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Settlements/Nysadell/Nysadell\|Nysadell]] before, but [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Settlements/Nysadell/The Hollow Frost\|The Hollow Frost]] changed everything. They were reduced from prestigious magical researchers to simply a branch in [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Hierarchy/Heralds Corps/Heralds Corps\|Heralds Corps]] or refuges at [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Settlements/Everstead/Everstead\|Everstead]]. Some managed to retain high-ranking positions in [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Settlements/Everstead/Everstead\|Everstead]], but their glory is in the past.
