This is the name of the disaster that struck [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Settlements/Nysadell/Nysadell\|Nysadell]]. A giant frost emerged from the north east, quickly submerging and killing everything in its path. Luckily, the [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Races/Elves\|elves]] saw it coming and had time to evacuate, but the city itself wasn't as lucky. Now the [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Races/Elves\|elves]] are refuges at [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Settlements/Everstead/Everstead\|Everstead]] with some managing to get themselves in higher positions, but none forgot the tragedy that stole their home.
