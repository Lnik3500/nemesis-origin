Pelburg remains a vital woodworking village, supplying [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Settlements/Everstead/Everstead\|Everstead]] with the important wood from [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Regions/Asura/Lunenhill Grove/Lunenhill Grove\|Lunenhill Grove]]. While it has lost its status as the primary [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Races/Humans\|human]] settlement, it is still an important town hub of loggers, sawmills, and trade caravans. This town is mainly used for its lumber trade and still is an important dependency for [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Settlements/Everstead/Everstead\|Everstead]], who can't function without this supply flow.
