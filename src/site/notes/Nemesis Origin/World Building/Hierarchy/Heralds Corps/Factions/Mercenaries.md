## Beast Wardens (Monster Hunters, Creature Control Specialists)
Their job is to cull the creatures when necessary. Tracking, hunting and neutralizing creatures are part of their job and to make sure no creature is endangering settlements, trade or exploration. It's as simple as it can be: killing monsters.

### Mission:
- Track, hunt, and neutralize dangerous creatures that threaten civilization.
- Capture beasts for study, breeding, or controlled use in combat.
- Train squads to handle large-scale incursions (e.g., wyvern attacks, undead hordes).
- Investigate reports of rogue beasts, mutant abominations, and escaped experimental creatures.

### Methods:
- Use a mix of alchemy, runes, traps, and specialized weapons.
- Develop countermeasures for magical beasts and difficult creatures.
- Work closely with [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Hierarchy/Heralds Corps/Factions/Explorers\|Wildlife Observers]] to balance conservation and extermination.

### Internal Culture:
- Operates like an elite monster-hunting order.
- Highly superstitious. Many adopt rituals to protect against curses or beasts.
- A deep respect for their prey, believing in killing only when necessary.

## Bounty Stalkers (Investigating Specialists, Independent Hunters)
This faction is broad in many ways, but all converge on the idea of enforcing law, hunting down high-profile criminals and tracking down fugitives. They're the ones that make sure that bandits aren't a common occurrence. This faction consists mainly of those that tracks down and hunts criminals (Capturing Individuals Agency), and those that analyzes and locates criminals (Federation of Bureaucratic Investigators).

### Mission:
- Tracking and capturing (or killing) fugitives and rogue [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Hierarchy/Heralds Corps/Heralds Corps\|Heralds Corps]] members.
- Take on classified assassination missions against enemies too dangerous to leave alive.
- Act as roaming lawmen, ensuring that no criminal escapes justice.
- Breaking up bandit groups, smuggling rings, and rogue mercenary factions.

### Methods:
- Usage of magical scrying, scent-tracking, blood markers, or interrogations to hunt down targets.
- Some disguises themselves, forges identities, and infiltrates criminal circles to gather intel.
- Some prefer lethal methods, ending them before they even know they were a target. Others prefer non-lethal, disabling them and dragging them in alive to receive higher pays.

### Internal Culture:
- A few work for personal reasons, seeking vengeance, justice, or even redemption.
- No rules. No masters. No second chances from your target. You hunt, or you become the hunted.
- Unlike other factions, rank means nothing. The strongest, smartest, and most effective earn the best contracts.

## Sentinel Guardians (Lawbringers, Protectors)

They are the backbone of security.

### Internal Culture:
- Sentinel Guardians are a force of order and strictly regulated.
- Though strict, they value camaraderie. Sentinels trust each other with their lives.
- They are expected to never abandon their post, even at the cost of their lives, especially with the existence of the [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Settlements/Everstead/Revival Altar\|revival altar]].
