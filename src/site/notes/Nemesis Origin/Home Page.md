## What to Expect
There are 4 major themes for this campaign:
- This is a godless world. This world contains no gods and its world is shaped solely by its own creatures and environment. No gods will protect this world and no gods will dictate what the people can and cannot do. Some think gods possibly existed in the past, but no religion or historians can demonstrate that. 
- [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Hierarchy/Heralds Corps/Heralds Corps\|Heralds Corps]] is a giant monopoly. They do everything to run the society. Only people working for this giant monopoly has access to the [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Settlements/Everstead/Revival Altar\|revival altar]] after all. 
- Easy access to resurrection. the [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Settlements/Everstead/Revival Altar\|revival altar]] made death a minor inconvenience for some and has over time made the meaning of death not as meaningful. Since [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Hierarchy/Heralds Corps/Heralds Corps\|Heralds Corps]] works only in [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Settlements/Everstead/Everstead\|Everstead]], what about [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Settlements/Kurbadur/Kurbadur\|Kurbadur]] and the [[Nemesis Origin/World Building/Races/Dwarves\|dwarves]]?
- Exploration & adventure. Overall, the theme of this campaign emphasizes adventure. I want the PCs to enjoy new challenges, take in new sights and slowly uncover the mysteries.

## What to Keep in Mind
- There will be different environments. I suggest planning for cold and hot environments or possibly other weathers.
- Due to the nature of RPG Maker Maps, ledges will all be 5ft high. All PCs and NPCs will have powerful leap for free to increase jump height to 5 ft
- Leveling will be fast. Each act has around 3 levels each and are milestone based. Depends on side quests (I have a few levels planned for side questing to not penalize.)
- Clerics and Champions are still allowed, but don't base themselves on deities since they don't exist.
