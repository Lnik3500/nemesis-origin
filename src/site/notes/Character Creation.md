**Starting Level:** 3
**Starting GP:** 75 gp
**Runes:** Weapon Potency, Striking, Armor Potency and Resilient are free, as well as starting weapons (if you work for [[World Building/Hierarchy/Heralds Corps/Heralds Corps\|Heralds Corps]])
**Variant Rules:** Dual-Class, Free Archetype, Ancestry Paragon. High Quality Variant
**No Relics**
**Rarity:** Preferably Common Rarity. Will most likely include Uncommon and Rare stuff if asked.
**Side Note:** Since I'm using RPG Maker maps, it's given me the chance to play with terrain height a lot, but they all have a minimum of 5 feet height to get up. Everyone gets **Powerful Leap** for free.
This height applies to creatures as well, so abusing height can give you a big advantage in some fights.
**Type of Campaign to Expect:** I'm not as confident in Roleplay and Flexibility, but I wanna make it enjoyable. Most of my inspirations are from JRPGs and games all around more than actual stories. Some aspects might not feel as logical, but I'm confident in being able to give interesting fights, gimmicks / objectives, and make you enjoy a story. The RPG Maker maps might make it feel a bit more "gamey" still.
