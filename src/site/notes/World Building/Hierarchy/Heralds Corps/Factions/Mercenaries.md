## Beast Wardens (Monster Hunters, Creature Control Specialists)
Their job is to cull the creatures when necessary. Tracking, hunting and neutralizing creatures are part of their job and to make sure no creature is endangering settlements, trade or exploration. It's as simple as it can be: killing monsters.

### Mission:
- Track, hunt, and neutralize dangerous creatures that threaten civilization.
- Capture beasts for study, breeding, or controlled use in combat.
- Train squads to handle large-scale incursions (e.g., wyvern attacks, undead hordes).
- Investigate reports of rogue beasts, mutant abominations, and escaped experimental creatures.

### Methods:
- Use a mix of alchemy, runes, traps, and specialized weapons.
- Develop countermeasures for magical beasts and difficult creatures.
- Work closely with [[World Building/Hierarchy/Heralds Corps/Factions/Explorers\|Wildlife Observers]] to balance conservation and extermination.

### Internal Culture:
- Operates like an elite monster-hunting order.
- Highly superstitious. Many adopt rituals to protect against curses or beasts.
- A deep respect for their prey, believing in killing only when necessary.
