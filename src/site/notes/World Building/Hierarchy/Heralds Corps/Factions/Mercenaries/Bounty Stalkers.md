This faction is broad in many ways, but all converge on the idea of enforcing law, hunting down high-profile criminals and tracking down fugitives. They're the ones that make sure that bandits aren't a common occurrence. This faction consists mainly of those that tracks down and hunts criminals (Capturing Individuals Agency), and those that analyzes and locates criminals (Federation of Bureaucratic Investigators).
