This faction is the closest there is to an army. They're the ones policing towns and settlements, making sure that the law is being upheld. They also guard traders, holdings of [[World Building/Hierarchy/Heralds Corps/Heralds Corps\|Heralds Corps]] and key locations from external or internal threats. They are the backbone of security.
