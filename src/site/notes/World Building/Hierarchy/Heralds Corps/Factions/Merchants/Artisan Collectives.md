Blacksmiths, Artisans, Engineers, etc. They're all part of this faction and are the ones producing the necessary resources for a society. They provide essential equipment as well for [[World Building/Hierarchy/Heralds Corps/Factions/Explorers\|explorers]], [[World Building/Hierarchy/Heralds Corps/Factions/Mercenaries\|mercenaries]] and even researchers. Without them, society would never progress and manage to build anything.
