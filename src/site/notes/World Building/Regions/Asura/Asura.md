Asura is a realm of diverse landscapes and rich histories, each corner telling a different tale of the land and its people. At the heart of Asura lies [[World Building/Regions/Asura/Easterden Meadow/Easterden Meadow\|Easterden Meadow]], a fertile expanse that serves as the region's vibrant center. Northwest, the lush canopy of [[World Building/Regions/Asura/Lunenhill Grove/Lunenhill Grove\|Lunenhill Grove]] whispers stories of early [[World Building/Races/Humans\|human]] settlements and deep-rooted traditions. To the northeast, the haunting beauty of [[World Building/Regions/Asura/Niamont Ice Plains\|Niamont Ice Plains]] stands as a frozen testament to the [[World Building/Races/Elves\|elven]] exodus driven by an enigmatic and relentless chill. The formidable [[World Building/Regions/Asura/Blainsward Mountains/Blainsward Mountains\|Blainsward Mountains]] in the north are both a bastion and a mystery, their imposing heights home to the industrious [[World Building/Races/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] and guarded by the monumental [[World Building/Races/Dwarves\|dwarven]] Wall against the volatile forces of nature.

In stark contrast, the southwest is dominated by the [[World Building/Regions/Asura/Sundorn Desert\|Sundorn Desert]], a vast and arid wilderness where nomadic tribes navigate between life-sustaining oases and sunken ruins that speak of ancient, forgotten civilisations. Finally, the southeast is graced by the [[World Building/Regions/Asura/Serevin Isles\|Serevin Isles]], a beautiful yet perilous chain of islands. The isles are a haven for pirates and explorers alike, with their dense tropical vegetation, treacherous coral reefs, and legends of hidden treasures and ancient sea creatures.
