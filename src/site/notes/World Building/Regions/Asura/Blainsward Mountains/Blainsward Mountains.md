The northern Blainsward Mountains are a formidable range, home to the proud and industrious [[World Building/Races/Dwarves\|dwarves]]. These mountains are rich in minerals and precious stones, mined by the [[World Building/Races/Dwarves\|dwarves]] who live in [[World Building/Settlements/Kurbadur\|Kurbadur]]. The Blainsward Mountains are fiercely protected by a gigantic [[World Building/Races/Dwarves\|dwarven]] wall, built to shield the inhabitants from the dangerous lava ash that periodically erupts from the range's volcanic activity. The wall, an architectural marvel, also serves as a symbol of [[World Building/Races/Dwarves\|dwarven]] resilience and craftsmanship.
