In the heart of the northwest region of [[World Building/Regions/Asura/Asura\|World Building/Regions/Asura/Asura]] lies Lunenhill Grove, a sprawling forest shrouded in mystery and magic. Here, towering trees reach towards the sky, their ancient branches entwined with secrets whispered by the wind.

However, beyond the outskirts of [[World Building/Settlements/Pelburg\|Pelburg]] lies a realm of enchantment and danger. The forest is not solely the domain of [[World Building/Races/Humans\|humans]]; it is also home to [[World Building/Races/Goblins\|goblins]] and [[World Building/Races/Faes\|fae]], who dwell amidst the shadows and ancient groves, weaving their own tales of magic and mischief. These inhabitants of Lunenhill Grove coexist in an uneasy balance with the [[World Building/Races/Humans\|human]] settlers, their presence adding an element of unpredictability to the forest's tranquil facade.
