Pelburg remains a vital woodworking village, supplying [[World Building/Settlements/Everstead/Everstead\|Everstead]] with the important wood from [[World Building/Regions/Asura/Lunenhill Grove/Lunenhill Grove\|World Building/Regions/Asura/Lunenhill Grove/Lunenhill Grove]]. While it has lost its status as the primary [[World Building/Races/Humans\|human]] settlement, it is still an important town hub of loggers, sawmills, and trade caravans. This town is mainly used for its lumber trade and still is an important dependency for [[World Building/Settlements/Everstead/Everstead\|Everstead]], who can't function without this supply flow.
