The resurrect altar is the resurrect ritual, automatically succeeding, but never critically succeeding.

The revival altar is the prime benefit of working for [[World Building/Hierarchy/Heralds Corps/Heralds Corps\|Heralds Corps]]. Many years past, it was revealed that resurrection was as easy as a simple ritual, with the costs needed to perform it being simply covered. This made adventuring a lot less risky and benefitted many into not fearing for their lives as much. 

However, as a side effect, many people became numb to the idea of death. [[World Building/Hierarchy/Heralds Corps/Heralds Corps\|Heralds Corps]] and the [[World Building/Hierarchy/Heralds Corps/Grand Council\|council]] has a monopoly on it too, charging massive sums to those not working for them and making a stark contrast to those that don't benefit the corps.
